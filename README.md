## COMP1110 Lectures

This repository contains code written in-class.  You should clone this repo directly, rather than fork it (create a new project in IntelliJ from git using the URL `https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/comp1110/comp1110-lectures.git`).   You should think of it as read-only; I will update the content at the end of each lecture and you can update your clone by doing a git pull (VCS -> Git -> Pull).
